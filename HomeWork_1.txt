15) Find a file by name

16) View the contents of files in real-time (grep command), learn how it works

    To view the content of the file in real-time I've used the 'more' command. 
    The syntax is as follows:
    more FileName

    Grep command searches the given file for lines containing a match to the given strings or words.
    The syntax is as follows:
    grep 'string' FileName - search any line that contains the 'string' in the FileName
    grep 'string' FileName_pattern — checking for the given string in multiple files
    grep -i 'string' FileName - case insensitive search using grep -i
    grep -w 'string' FileName - checking for full words, not for sub-strings
    grep -r 'string' * - checking for the 'string' in all the files in the current directory and all its subdirectory

17) Show the first few lines from a text file 
— head -n 2 File1.txt 
(where -n 2 is the number of shown lines, by default it will print 10 top lines)

18) Show the last few lines from a text file
 - tail -n 2 File1.txt
(where -n 2 is the number of shown lines, by default it will print 10 top lines)

19)View the content of a large file (less command) learn how it works
 — less FileName
   The most frequently used commands to navigate through the file content:
Down arrow, Enter, e, j - Move forward one line
Up arrow, y, k - Move backward one line
Space bar or f - Move Forward one page
b - Move Backward one page
n - Repeat previous search
N - Repeat previous search in reverse direction
g - Go to the first line in the file
Ng - Go to the N-th line in the file
G - Go to the last line in the file
q - Exit less.

20) Show date and time 
— date
